                It was a dark night and was raining heavily and there were strange noises from every where and voice of  the moaning of jackals could be heard. 
Although there was a  bad atmosphere king Vikramaditya did not fear a bit. He climbed the tree to bring the corpse down and soon he began to walk with the corpse lying on his shoulder.

                The Betaal spoke: "O King , I pity you as you are making untiring efforts without relaxing as if you wish to achieve something. Instead of enjoying a comfortable sleep in your palace  you’re still coming after me”  
King didn’t speak anything because any word from his mouth would keep Betaal right back on the tree. 
So Betaal starts his story……….
