                Long long ago, Kanchannagar was being ruled by King Chandradeep . His daughter was Indumati . Being an only child, the princess was brought up like a boy, and given training in the use of arms an warfare. The princes of many of the neighbouring kingdoms cherished a desire to marry Indumati, who was, extremely beautiful.

                Whenever the king broached the subject of marriage, Indumati said "Yes,  but... Whoever marries me must be strong and brave. And he must succeed in the tests that I give."
